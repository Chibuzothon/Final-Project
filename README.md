# INST126 Final Project 
## House Prices Analysis 
**Histogram for number of bedrooms vs number of houses**



**What Program Does:**

-Loads the path of a CSV file that has data on Houses in America. Then it reads the file and prints the data as a table.

-Then provides the statistical analysis of the values in each column of the table 

-Focuses on the number of bedrooms in the house, by looking at the columns and rows where the number of bedrooms is less than 9. Then saves this data into a dataframe & dispalys the dataframe.
Then counts the number of houses that has bedrooms that are less than 9. Groups each count by the number of bedrooms.

-Histogram plots the beds column of the dataframe vs the the number of houses that have that number of bedrooms. Then displays histogram.


**Bar graph for number of bedrooms vs average price**



**What Program Does:**


-Creates a dataframe that focuses on the houses where the total number of bedrooms that is less than 9.

-Then it takes the average prices of the houses based on the number of bedrooms.

-Since the number of beds is an index in the dataframe, the index (bed count) was put into a column. Then shows the updated dataframe, with the price as a colunm and bed count as the other column.  

-Plots a bar graph for the bedroom count vs average prices of the houses based on bedroom count and displays the bar graph.
