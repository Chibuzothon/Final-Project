## House Prices Analysis 
Histogram for number of bedrooms vs number of houses 
What Program Does:

-Loads the path of a CSV file that has data on Houses in America. Then it reads the file and prints the data as a table.

-Then provides the statistical analysis of the values in each coulumn of the table 

-Focuses on the number of bedrooms in the house, by looking at the columns and rows where the number of bedrooms is less than 9. Then counts the number of houses that has bedrooms that are less than 9. Groups each count by the number of bedrooms

-Saves that data into a dataframe & plots the data frame as a histogram


Bar graph for number of bedrooms vs average price 
What Program Does:

-Creates a dataframe that focuses on the houses where the total number of bedrooms that is less than 9.

-Then it takes the average prices of the houses based on the number of bedrooms

-Since the number of beds is an index in the dataframe, the index (bed count) was put into a column

-Plots a bar graph for the bedroom count vs average prices of the houses
