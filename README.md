*Focuses on the number of beds in the house, by looking at the columns and rows where the beds is less than 9. Then count the number of houses that have beds that are less than 9. Groups each count by the number of houses

*Saves that data into a dataframe & plots the data fram as a historgram

*Creates a dataframe that focuses on the housees where the total number of beds that is less than 9.
